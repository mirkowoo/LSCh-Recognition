# LSCh-Recognition
This is a project focused in the developing of an app and a database for a hand gesture recognition via camera using Yolo libs 

Since it's creation, I've managed to create a python app that uses your camera tosearch for LSCh signs (Lengua de Se√±as Chilena).

It's a WIP.

If you wanna use GPU (might run better), you need to install torch for your CUDA version

pip install -r requirements.txt
