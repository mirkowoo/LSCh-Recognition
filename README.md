# LSCh-Recognition
This is a project focused in the developing of an app and a database for a hand gesture recognition via camera using Yolo libs 

Since it's creation, I've managed to create a python app that uses your camera tosearch for LSCh signs (Lengua de Se√±as Chilena).

I've been testing some libs for desktop apps deployment, the yivy folder contains the yivy interface, and the streamlit folder contains the streamlit development of the app.

If you wanna use GPU (might run better), you need to install torch for your CUDA version

pip install -r requirements.txt
